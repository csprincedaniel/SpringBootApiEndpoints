For the sake of getting a lot of practice with Java Spring boot and backend web development, I am going to create a lot of api endpoints.

SO FAR WE COMPLETED [TO DO LIST / NOTES API, ]

UP NEXT: PUBLIC HOLIDAY API

The endpoints will be for the following:

1. to do list api,
2. user authentication api,
3. notes app api,
4. simple blog api,
5. book library api,
6. weather fetch proxy,
7. basic chat api,


We can even do:
1. Daily Motivation API
Returns a random quote, short video, or image.
Optional: filter by category or author.

2. Timezone Conversion API
Input: location or timestamp.
Output: converted time in another zone.

3. Public Holidays API
Input: country code.
Output: list of upcoming holidays.

4. Simple Weather API Proxy
Wrap an external API (like OpenWeather) with simplified output.
Cache responses to reduce external calls.



I will write the data to variables or objects. I will not use an official database yet until it's time for my discord clone project.

BONUS: I will also have a front end call to the back end to have a mini full stack application!

(To run application you must make sure the spring boot server is running. Go to ) com.example.demo.DemoApplication.Java, and press run in visual studio. Then you can open any of the html files and it should connect. You must have java installed on your computer.
