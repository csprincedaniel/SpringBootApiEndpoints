For the sake of getting a lot of practice with Java Spring boot and backend web development, I am going to create a lot of api endpoints.

The endpoints will be for the following:

1. to do list api,
2. user authentication api,
3. notes app api,
4. simple blog api,
5. book library api,
6. weather fetch proxy,
7. basic chat api,

I will write the data to variables or objects. I will not use an official database yet until it's time for my discord clone project.

BONUS: I will also have a front end call to the back end to have a mini full stack application!
